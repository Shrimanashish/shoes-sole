				<p>We all know that every foot is different and every individual needs solutions based on his activity and body type, so our tagline says,” Every soul is special “ 
                We are familiar with terms such as structured, unstructured, high arch, low arch, pronating and supinating. And we probably know at least one person who has dealt with the painful condition of plantar fasciitis. Our medical professionals have teamed up to match you with an optimal insole. What type of insole do you need for your specific foot type? Which orthotic could help relieve your foot pain? Our “insole advisor” may be able to help you answer this question!
